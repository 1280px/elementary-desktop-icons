# Desktop Icons for eOS/Pantheon

Most of current approaches re-invent the wheel and create their own desktop icons from scratch.

However, why not just use polished and well-maintained desktop icons implementations from other DEs that provide it as a separate component?

And this exactly what this project aims to do â€” it installs either `xfdekstop4` (from XFCE) or `nemo-desktop` (from Nemo) with a few customization tweaks, this way providing well-working desktop icons that look very native-like. It also installs a custom `Win+D` shortcut that allows to show/hide desktop quickly.

> NOT MAINTAINED because I long moved from Pantheon to GNOME, but feel free to commit or fork!
